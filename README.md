## Thanks for looking

This is the recipe app option.  I am very happy with it considering the time limit.  Given more time, I would have liked to complete adding and updating recipes, as well as testing.  I feel a little uneasy handing in work without tests, but that's life, and I want to respect the timing aspect of the task.  I did, however, add a dark mode because I don't like looking at bright, white screens. Thanks for taking a look. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
